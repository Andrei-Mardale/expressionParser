# expressionParser
My second Object Oriented Programming homework

A Java implementation of an expression parser.
Given a set of rules for a language described in the statement, the program will build and output the expression tree, perform semantic analysis and finally evaluate the given expressions.

#How to compile
"run.sh"

#How to run
"run.sh inputFilename" where inputFilename is the input file

#Input
The input should follow the rules described in the statement. It may contain semantic errors which the program will detect and announce.

#Output
The programm will output 3 files:
* the expression tree
* the semantic analysis, and if the expression passes this test
* the final results of the given expression
